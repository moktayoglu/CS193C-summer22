<p>I am a senior undergraduate student double majoring in molecular biology and genetics, and
 computer engineering at Koc University, Turkey. I am at <span class = "stanford">Stanford</span> as an International Honors 
 Program student for this summer session. I am currently interested in using machine learning
 to come up with new drug and antibody structures. Before coming to <span class = "stanford">Stanford</span>, I was working as an undergraduate
  researcher in Karaca Lab working for a machine learning model for predicting interacting pairs during molecular dynamics simulations.
  For the same group I also worked in a benchmarking study of common binding-energy change predictors. In that project, I employed
  a voting procedure among the predictors, and did various analysis on the binding energy enhancing and depleting mutation cases.</p>

<p>Prior to that, I've interned at Optofil where I helped developing a deep learning based bench-top automated cell 
counter. Also, during the pandemic I was co-authoring a review article on the bio-printed gliomablastoma models. I also tutored
for multiple classes in my university which were Cell Biology and Development, MATLAB and Java courses. For the Java course
I was a section leader for problem sessions. This was adopted from our university from the section leadings done for CS106 here at <span class = "stanford">Stanford</span>.</p>

<p>I am also currently a member of Google Developer Students Club at Koc University, ISCB-RSG Turkey, ACM and iGEM communities.
For them I help organizing events and talks in the areas of technology, biology, computation and science.</p>


<p>In my free time I like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing yoga</li>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Listening to <a href="https://hubermanlab.com" class="external">podcasts</a></li>
<li>Traveling</li>
<li>Being a mother to two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" class="external">cats</a> (named Macit and Efe)</li>
</ul>
